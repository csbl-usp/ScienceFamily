The privacy of the skill users is important to me, and I have personal committment to safeguarding it.
This policy explains what we will do with your personal information.

The Science Grandma skill requires access to Google Drive in order to function perfectly and get your protocols by name. 
The skill searches, but do not store anywhere, metadata related to files on Google Drive.
The access token for the metadata is saved on your Alexa-enabled device and nowhere else.

The  Science Grandma skill can be authorized to read content in spreadsheets which is not shared, stored or made available anywhere.

Only spreadsheets with the exact name 'Science Grandma' will be acessed, but no information regarding it will be stored by Science Grandma.

Information retrieved will be used exclusively to build temporary responses for the skill.

We may update this policy in the future, so you should check this page for ocasional changes. We will try our best to let you know in the case of important changes.
