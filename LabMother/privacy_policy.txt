The Lab Mother skill requires access to Google Drive in order to function perfectly. 
The skill searches, but do not store anywhere, metadata related to files on Google Drive.
The access token for the metadata is saved on your Alexa-enabled device and nowhere else.

The  Lab Mother skill can be authorized to read content in spreadsheets which is not shared, stored or made available anywhere.

Only spreadsheets with the exact name 'Lab Mother' will be acessed, but no information regarding it will be store.

Information retrieved will be used exclusively to build temporary responses for the skill.
